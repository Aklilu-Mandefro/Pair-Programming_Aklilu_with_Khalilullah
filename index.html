      <h3 id="headline">Here's a Short Journey of Zukerberg:</h3>
      <ul>
        </li><strong><U>The Background</U></strong> - Mark Zuckerberg's background story is a much-popularised one.
        A young prodigy, Zuckerberg had a knack for working with computers. During his time at Harvard
        University, he soon came to be known as a go-to software developer. In his sophomore year, he
        built FaceMash, which was based on the concept of 'Hot' or 'Not' - the user was shown pictures
        of two students from the university and asked to choose the more attractive of the two. Even though
        it was shut down by the Harvard administration a few days later, the initial traction it got - 450 visitors
        and 22,000 photo-views in the first four hours - was something that got Zuckerberg excited, and he continued
        to build upon this project. He created a social study tool where he uploaded art images, and allowed students
        to add their comments and share notes. Mark Zuckerberg's status as a developer and acumen for launching great
        products got the attention of Harvard seniors Divya Narendra and Cameron & Tyler Winklevoss. The trio were
        planning to build a social networking site for Harvard students, and convinced Zuckerberg to join their team.

        <li>
          <strong><U>The Balancing</U></strong> - In 2003, Harvard did not have a universal "facebook". They had
          a paper version and an online repository that contained student photos & personal information
          of students staying in a particular dorm. "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face
          book within Harvard. I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years
          to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week", said Zuckerberg
          to The Harvard Crimson. In January 2004, Mark Zuckerberg launched "The Facebook", inspired by a Crimson
          editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized website
          is readily available ... the benefits are many". With an investment of ~$2000, along with Harvard fellow
          students Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Eduardo Saverin, he built The Facebook from his dorm. This
          was the same time when Zuckerberg was working in parallel for HarvardConnection.com.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><U>The Launch</U></strong> - The site was launched as The Facebook on February 4, 2004, and later
          morphed to
          Facebook after the domain facebook.com was acquired for US $200,000.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><U>Other interesting points</U></strong> - At the age of 12, Mark Zuckerberg used Atari BASIC to
          create a
          messaging program he named "Zucknet". It allowed all the computers between the house and his father's dental
          office to communicate with each other. Also, his family used Zucknet to communicate within the house.

          - Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg's background story has been portrayed in the 2010 film 'The Social Network'.

          The biggest risk is not taking any risk... In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that
          is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks.
